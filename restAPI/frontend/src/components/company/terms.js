                <p><strong>Risk Disclosure</strong></p>
                <p>CFDs are leveraged products. CFD trading may not be suitable for everyone and can result in losses that exceed your initial investment. Please ensure that you fully understand the risks involved.</p>
                <p>In light of the risks involved, you should undertake such transactions only if you understand the nature of the contracts (and contractual relationships) into which you are entering and the extent of your exposure to the risks. Trading in CFDs may not be suitable for many members of the public. You should carefully consider whether such trading is appropriate for you in the light of your experience, objectives, financial resources and other relevant circumstances. In considering whether to trade, please be aware of the margin requirements, commissions, fees and other charges for which you will be liable. These charges will affect your net profit (if any) or increase your loss.</p>
